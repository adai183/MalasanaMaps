### Description
> You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your
> neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add
> additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to
> identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to
> easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of
> all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that
> provide additional information about each of these locations (such as
> StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
